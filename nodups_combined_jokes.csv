10,10," An elderly lady phoned her telephone company to report that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called - and that on the few occasions when it did ring, her pet dog always moaned right before the phone rang. The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile elderly lady. He climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned loudly and the telephone began to ring. Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found: 1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. 
 2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.
 3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.
 4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.
 5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phoneto ring.

He couldn't decide   which son he could send to college, since he could only afford to send one. This farmer also had two ducks.  These ducks were retarded.  They were only two ducks on the farm that weren't normal.  He told his sons that whoever could get the most money for the duck would go to college. The sons   went out in attempt to collect as much money as   they could.    The first son was walking down the street when he passed a man working in the yard.  The man asked him if the duck was for sale, for the man loved the taste of ducks.  He offered the son 10 dollars for his duck.  The son decided this was very good, so he took it.  He decided his brother wouldn't be able to get close to his success. The second son was walking and passed a whorehouse.  He went in and said that he didn't have any money, but he would give them the duck.  One girl said fine. After they f**ked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore.  The son said he would take the duck back if they f**ked again.  She agreed.  After they f**ked the second time, the son left. He was walking home, thinking about what to do with the duck when it broke the leash.  The duck ran out into the street and was hit by a car.  The lady that hit it jumped from her car and started apologizing profusely.  The son insisted it was ok, but the lady said she would pay for the duck.  She was in a hurry, so she gave him 25 dollars and sped off. When the sons got home, the farmer asked the first son what he got.  He proudly displayed the 10 dollars.  The farmer was impressed.

British engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the windshield of their new high speed trains.   Arrangements were made.  But when the gun was fired, the engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurtled out of the barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens, crashed through the control console, snapped the engineer's backrest in two and embedded itself in the back wall of the cabin.

The current rooster was   still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in  years and the farmer figured getting a new rooster   couldn't hurt.  So he buys a new cock from the   local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the   barnyard.    Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting   around and he's a little worried about being replaced. He walks up to   the new bird. ""So you're the new stud in   town?  I bet you really think you're hot stuff   don't you?  Well I'm not ready for the chopping   block yet.  I'll bet I'm still the better bird.    And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around   that hen house over there.  We'll run around it   ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have   all the hens for himself."" Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he   definitely thought he was more than a match for   the old guy. ""You're on,"" he said, ""and since   I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of   half a lap.  I'll still win easy!"" So the two roosters go over to the henhouse to   start the race with all the hens gathering to   watch.  The race begins and all the hens start   cheering the old rooster on.  After the first lap,   the old rooster is still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guy's lead has   slipped a little -- but he's still hanging in there.  Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to   slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's   just barely in front of the young fella.    By now the farmer has heard the commotion.  He   runs into the house, gets his shotgun and runs   into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is   after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees   the two roosters running around the henhouse,   with the old rooster still slightly in the lead.    He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and   blows the young rooster away. ""Damn. That's the third gay rooster I've bought this month.""

Don't order a bottle of pop or a can of soda -- this can lead to a merciless beating. Down South it's called Coke, even if you want a Pepsi. 4.  Don't show allegiances to any college football squad that isn't an SEC team. All the others are a bunch of candy asses who get to play Wyoming every week. 5.  Don't refer to Southerner's as a bunch of hillbillies. Many of us are/have been more literate than you (e.g. Welty, Williams, Faulkner), better educated, and generally much nicer to boot.  We've got plenty of business sense (e.g.Turner Broadcasting, MCI WorldCom, MTV, and Netscape). Naturally, we can have lapses of judgment from time to time (e.g. Clinton, Fordice, Duke). We don't care if you think we're dumb, we know better! 6.  We are fully aware that the humidity is high. Quit your bitching, spend your money, and leave. 7.  Don't order wheat toast at the Cracker Barrel. If you do this, everyone will know you're from Ohio. Eat the biscuits like God intended and for goodness sake, don't put sugar in your grits.    8.  Don't attempt to fake a Southern accent.  Nothing will incite a riot faster. 9.  Don't go around talking about how much better it is back home.  If you don't like it here, take your Yankee ass back home. 10. We don't play lacrosse, hockey or any of those other sissy ass Northern games, so don't ask about the scores. We...simply...don't...care. 11. We know how to speak proper English, we talk this way because we want to and we can. It's like playing jazz, you have to know how to do it right first. 12. Last, but by no means least...DO NOT try to tell us how to Bar-B-Q. This could lead to permanent expulsion and revocation of your work visa.

3158,3698,"Where do the characters go when I use my backspace or delete them on my PC?  
 ANSWER: The characters go to different places, depending on whom you ask: The Buddhist explanation: If a character has lived rightly, and its karma  is good, then after it has been deleted it will be reincarnated as a different, higher character. Those funny characters above the numbers on  your keyboard will become numbers, numbers will become letters, and lower-case letters will become upper-case. The 20th-century bitter cynical nihilist explanation: Who cares? It doesn't really matter if they're on the page, deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc. It's all the same. The Mac user's explanation: All the characters written on a PC and then  deleted go to straight to PC hell. If you're using a PC, you can probably see the deleted characters, because you're in PC hell also. Stephen King's explanation: Every time you hit the (Del) key you unleash a tiny monster inside the cursor, who tears the poor, unsuspecting characters to shreds, drinks their blood, then eats them, bones and all.  Hah, hah, hah! The Christian Church's approach to characters: The nice characters go to  Heaven, where they are bathed in the light of happiness. The naughty characters are punished for their sins. Naughty characters are those involved in the creation of naughty words, such as ""breast,"" ""sex,"" and contraception."" Dave Barry's explanation: The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where they're made into Pop-Tart filling; this explains why Pop-Tarts are so flammable, while cheap imitations are not flammable.  I'm not making this up. IBM's explanation: The characters are not real. They exist only on the screen when they are needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to de-conceptualize them. Get a life. PETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) explanation: You've  been DELETING them??? Can't you hear them SCREAMING???

3366,4044,"1. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play.
 2. Play must be permitted by the owner of the hole.
 3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.
 4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.  Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.
 5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole.
 6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is  satisfied that play is completed.  Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.
 7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the  hole immediately upon arrival at the course.  The  experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well-formed bunkers.
 8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, or are currently  playing, to the owner of the course being  played.  Angry course owners have been known to damage players' equipment for this reason.
 9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.
 10. Players should ensure that the match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time.  Previous players have been known to  become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course.
 11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.  Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair.  Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case.
 12.  The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of alignment with, and approach to the hole.
 13. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine.
 14. Slow play is encouraged.  However, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.
 15.  It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.  ",Gross,,,,http://jokes.cc.com/funny-gross/feab7p/rules-of-bedroom-golf

Kennedy Airport: The tile under the urinals in the Arrivals Building has that familiar lemony tinge; rubber soles stick to it. Over in Amsterdam, the tile under Schiphol's urinals would pass inspection in an operating room. But nobody notices. What everybody does notice is that each urinal has a fly in it. Look harder, and the fly turns into the black outline of a fly, etched into the porcelain. ""It improves the aim,"" says Aad Kieboom. ""If a man sees a fly, he aims at it."" Mr. Kieboom, an economist, directs Schiphol's own building expansion. His staff conducted fly-in-urinal trials and found that etchings reduce spillage by 80%. The Dutch will transfer the technology to New York. ""We will put flies in the urinals yes,"" Jan Jansen says in a back office at the Arrivals Building.

3468,4209,"Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is  larger than the shaft.  The study took two years   and cost over $1.2 million.  The study concluded   that the reason the head of a man's penis is   larger than the shaft was to provide the man   with more pleasure during sex. After the results were published, France decided   to conduct their own study on the same subject.    They were convinced that the results of the   British study was incorrect.

3486,4235,"Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same: Farts. Seventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions. Holders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk. Desk Jockey -  When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: 
 - Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females. - Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event. Meetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in. Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like. Aisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident. The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice. Broom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet. I found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. People will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet. Of course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky. And remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.

So to prevent this, he visited the local sex shop in order to buy his wife a vibrator to keep her occupied in his absence. After examining the products, he hadn't found an appropriately amazing vibrator and asked the store clerk for help. The store clerk recommended the ""Voodoo D**k."" ""How does it work?"" asked the businessman. The clerk unwrapped the Voodoo D**k from its ceremonial tiki box and said to it, ""Voodoo D**k that door."" The vibrator flew out of the box and attacked the door with such vigor that the door split in half. ""Fantastic,"" said the man. ""I'll take it!"" He instructed his wife on how to use the Voodoo D**k and left on his business trip. Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: ""Voodoo D**k my p***y."" The Voodoo D**k flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police. The policeman asked her why she was driving so recklessly and she explained to him that she had a Voodoo D**k inside her that wouldn't leave her alone.

4975,8470,"Introductory Chemistry at Duke has been taught for about a zillion years by Professor Bonk (really), and his course is semi-affectionately known as ""Bonkistry"". He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come up with something like this. Anyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the mid-terms and labs, etc., such that going into the final they had a solid A. These friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem final was on Monday), they decided to go up to U Virginia and party with some friends up there. They did this and had a great time.  However, with their hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Bonk after the final and explained to him why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to campus. Bonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were elated, relieved and very proud of their story. So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. They looked at the first problem, which was something simple about molarity and solutions and was worth 5 points. ""Cool,"" they thought, ""this is going to be easy."" They did that problem and turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page... WHICH TIRE?

5598,10757,"     A herd of buffalo can only move as fastas the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones atthe back of the herd that are killed first.  This natural selection is good for theherd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole herd is maintained oreven improved by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, thehuman brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which theelectrical signals pass. Recent emiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.   Thus, regular consumption of spirits helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of completing universitystudies and then getting married and settling down, most professionals cannot keep up withthe performance of the new graduates.  Only those few that stick to the strictregimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that theyachieved during their university years.     So, this is a call to arms.  As ourcountry is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes.  But getback into the bars  and pubs and quaff that pint!  Your company and your countryneeds you to be at your peak, and at your best, and you shouldn't deny yourself the careeropportunities that you could achieve through excessive alcohol consumption.  Takelife by the bottle and be all that you can be! And remember a good  cold beer willkill those bad, useless brain cells that are slowing you  down and it will make thenecessary room needed to get the good brain cells up front and at the top ready to performat their best.  So bottoms up, down  the hatch, look out brain it's coming fast!

5947,12878,"Remember the book ""Men are from Mars, Womenare from Venus""? Well, here's a prime example offered by an English professor atSouthern Methodist University: In-class Assignment for Wednesday: Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story. The process is simple.  Each person will pair off with the person sitting to his other immediate right.  One of you will then write the first paragraph of a short story.  The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story.  The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on back and forth.  Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent. The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached. The following was actually turned in by two of my  English students, Rebecca [last name deleted] and Gary [last namedeleted.] "" At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile.  But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl.  His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again.  So chamomile was out of the question. Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago.  ""A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,"" he said into his transgalactic communicator.  ""Polar orbit established.  No sign of resistance so far..."" But before he could sign off, a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay.  The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit. He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him.  Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. ""Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel,"" Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.  The news simultaneously excited  her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth  -- when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her.  ""Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?"" she pondered wistfully. Little did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live.  Thousands of miles above the city, the Au'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles.  The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless  target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet.  With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans.  The President slammed his fist on the conference table. ""We can't allow this!  I'm going to veto that treaty! Let's blow'em out of the sky!"" This is absurd.  I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic, semi-literate adolescent. Yeah?  Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium. Asshole.

 -- The message ""Bad command or file name"" is about as informative as, ""If you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to tell you.""
 -- Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.
 -- As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories.
 
 Why computers seem male:
 -- They have a lot of data but are still clueless.
 -- They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time, they are the problem.
 -- As soon as you commit to one you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have obtained a better model.
