              <li>We will present you with 20 jokes, one at a time.</li>
              <li>For each joke, you'll give us a rating of how good you think the joke is.</li>
              <li>We'll feed your ratings into our super-secret algorithm.</li>
              <li>Then we'll present you with some other jokes that we think you might like, and we'll have you rate those, too.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And that's about it!</p><br>
